NOTE: In its current form the IM only works locally.

Distributed isntant messager using a distributed hash table to handle identities (username and IP). Using a DHT allows any client to go down and still allow the messaging system to remain operational. My original idea was for in areas of spotty internet connectivity or civil unrest where uptime could not be guaranteed for a single server.
This particular implementation is more proof of concept than anything else, however, because it only operates locally.
